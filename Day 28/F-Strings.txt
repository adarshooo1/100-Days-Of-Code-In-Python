f-strings means:- formatting in the strings

It is a new string formatting mechanism introduced by the PEP 498. It is also known as literal Strings Interpolitation or more commonly as F-Strings
(f character preceding the strign literel). The primary focus of this mechanism is to make the interpolitation easier.

When we prefix the string with the letter 'f', the string becomes the f-string itself. The f-string can be formatted in much same as the
str.format() method. The f-string offers a convenient way to embed Python
expression inside string litera for foramtting.

Example:-
///////////////CODE//////////////////
Name = "Adarsh"
print(f"Hello{Name}) # Hello Adarsh
//////////////////////////////////////

Here is simply formatting the Name string with the Object.
