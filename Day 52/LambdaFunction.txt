In Python, a lambda function is a small,
anonymous function that is defined using the lambda keyword.
These functions are also known as anonymous or inline functions.
They are useful for situations where a small, throwaway function
is needed, such as in situations where a function is passed as an 
rgument to another function.

The syntax for a lambda function is as follows:
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
lambda arguments: expression
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The arguments are the inputs to the function, and the expression
is the single statement that is executed by the function. For example,
the following is a lambda function that takes two arguments and returns
their sum:

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
lambda x, y: x + y
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Lambda functions are often used in conjunction with other functional
programming constructs such as map(), filter(), and reduce(). These
functions take other functions as arguments, and lambda functions
are useful in these situations because they can be defined and passed
as arguments in a concise and readable way. For example:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This will return a map object, which will contain the squares of the
numbers from the given list.

It's important to note that lambda functions are limited in their
functionality compared to regular functions. They can only contain a
single expression, and they cannot contain statements or multiple expressions.
They also.
