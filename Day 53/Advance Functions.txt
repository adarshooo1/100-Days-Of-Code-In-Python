map() function: Map is a higher order function which is taking function as a function arguments.

Example:- map(cube,number) // Where cube is a function and number is a variable.

The map() function applies a
given function to all the
elements of an input list or other iterable
object. The function takes two arguments:
a function and an iterable. It applies the
function to each element of the iterable
and returns an iterable map object.

filter():
Filter is a function which taking a
function and variable inside the filter.But the difference
is function inside the filter is a type of boolean expression.
if condition is true then it will process the Variable

Example:- filter(filter_function,Numbers) //Here filter_function
returns only that number which is number%2 == 0; So, filter function
is filering the variable with the condition is passed.


The filter() function is used to filter elements from a given list or
other iterable object based on a specified condition. The function takes
two arguments: a function and an iterable. It applies the function to each
element of the iterable and returns an iterable filter object containing
only the elements for which the function returned True.The filter() function
is used to filter elements from a given list or other iterable object based
on a specified condition. The function takes two arguments: a function and an iterable.
It applies the function to each element of the iterable and returns an iterable filter
object containing only the elements for which the function returned True.

reduce():
To use the reduce function we have to import it forst then it will work:
/////////////CODE////////////////////
from functools inport reduce
    
    After that we can use reduce function.

//////////////////////////////////
The function argument is a function tat takes in two arguement ad returns a single value.
The iterable arguement is a sequence of elements, such as a list or tuple.

The reduce() function is used to reduce a list or other iterable object to a
single value by applying a given function to the elements in a cumulative manner.
The function takes two arguments: a function and an iterable. It applies the
function cumulatively to the elements of the iterable, from left to right,
so as to reduce the iterable to a single value.
