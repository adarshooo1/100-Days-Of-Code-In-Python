Introuction to Object-Oriented programming

Introuction to Object-Oriented Programming in python: In programming languages,
mainly there are two approaches that are used to write program and code.

>>1. Procedural Programming
>>2. Object-Oriented Programming

The procedural programming we are following till now is the "Procedural Programming" approach.
So, afterwards we will learn about OOPs.The basic idea of Object Oriented Prrogramming in python
is to use classes and objects to represent real-world concepts and entities.

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and 
methods that an object of that class will have. properties are the data or state of an object, 
and methods are the actions or behaviors that an object can be perform.


An object is an instance of a class, and it contains its own data and methods, for example,
