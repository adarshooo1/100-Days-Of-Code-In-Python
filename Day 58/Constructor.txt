In Python, a constructor is a special method that is automatically
called when an object is created from a class. The constructor method
is named init (with two underscores before and after "init").
The constructor method is used to initialize the attributes of an object,
and can accept arguments to set the initial state of the object.
For example, the following class has a constructor that accepts two
arguments, "name" and "age", and sets the initial values of the object's
attributes accordingly:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

person1 = Person("John", 30)
print(person1.name)  # Output: "John"
print(person1.age)  # Output: 30

It is important to note that the __init__ method is called automatically when
an object is created using the class, and there is no need to call it explicitly.
