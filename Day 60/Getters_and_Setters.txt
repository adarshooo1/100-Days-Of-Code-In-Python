In Python,
Getters and setters are methods used to access
and set the values of object attributes, respectively.
Getters are used to retrieve the value of an attribute,
while setters are used to set the value of an attribute.
These methods can be used to enforce encapsulation,
by controlling access to an object's attributes and
preventing unauthorized modification.
They are implemented using the @property and @attribute.setter decorators,
respectively.
