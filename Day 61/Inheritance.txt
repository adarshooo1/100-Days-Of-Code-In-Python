Inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP)
where a child class can inherit attributes and behaviors from a parent class.

This allows the child class to reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors
defined in the parent class.

In Python, inheritance is achieved by using the class inheritance mechanism,
where a class can inherit from one or multiple classes.

This helps to reduce code duplication and improves code maintainability.

Types Of Inheritance:-
1: Single Inheritance
2: Multiple Inheritance
3: Multi-level Inheritance
4: Hierarchical Inheritance
5: Hybrid Inheritance
