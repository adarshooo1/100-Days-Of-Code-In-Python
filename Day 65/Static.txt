A static method in Python is a method that belongs to a class rather
than an instance of the class. Unlike instance methods, static methods
do not receive any reference to the instance of the class and cannot
access or modify class-level or instance-level state. They are defined
using the @staticmethod decorator and are called on the class itself,


Static methods are often used for utility-style functions that don't
need access to instance-specific state, but instead operate on inputs
and produce outputs. For example:

class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

result = Math.add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
