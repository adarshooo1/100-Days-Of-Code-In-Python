In Pythron,classes are a way to define custom data types that can 
store data and define funcitons that can manipulate that data. 
One type of function that can be defined within a class is called a 
"Method". In this blog post, we will explore what Python class methods 
are, why they are useful, and how to use them.


In Python, class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not
the instance of the class. They are defined using the @classmethod decorator,
and take a reference to the class itself as the first argument, typically named
cls. Class methods can be used to alter the state of the class, create class-level
utility methods, or provide alternative constructors for a class.

class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    @classmethod
    def square(cls, side_length):
         return cls(side_length, side_length)

square = Rectangle.square(5)
print(square.width)
print(square.height)
