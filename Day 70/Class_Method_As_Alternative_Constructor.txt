A class method can be used as an alternative constructor in Python.
A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the
instance of the object. It is defined using the @classmethod decorator
and takes the class as the first argument, rather than self.

A common use case for class methods as alternative constructors is to
provide multiple ways to create objects from a class, each with a
different set of arguments.
