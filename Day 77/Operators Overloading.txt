Operator overloadingg is a feature that allows developers
to redefine the behaviour of mathematical and comparision operators
for custom data types. This means that you can use the standard mathematical
operators (+ , - , x , /, etc), and comparision operators (> , < , == ,etc) in 
your own classes, just as you would for the built-in-datatypes like int, float , and str.
