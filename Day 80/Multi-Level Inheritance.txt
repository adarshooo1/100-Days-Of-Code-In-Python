Multilevel Inheritance in Python is a type of Inheritance that involves inheriting a
class that has already inherited some other class. That means the derived/subclass
class inherits the features of the base class/parent class, and the new derived
class inherits the features of the derived class.

# Example 1:
class GrandFather:
    # Grand Father is the parent class:
    pass

class Father(GrandFather):
    # Father is the derived class from Grand Father.
    pass

class Son(Father):
    # Son class is the derived class and derived class itself is a derived class form Grand Father.
    pass
