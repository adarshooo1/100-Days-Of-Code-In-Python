A command line utility is a program that runs in a terminal or
command prompt and accepts input and output through the command line.
In Python, command line utilities are created using the argparse module,
which provides a framework for building command-line interfaces.

Using argparse, you can define command line arguments and options that your program accepts,
as well as provide help messages and error handling. Once you've defined your arguments,
you can use them in your program to perform specific actions based on the input.
