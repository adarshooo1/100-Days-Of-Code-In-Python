Type casting is the process of converting a value of one data type (e.g., an integer) to another data 
type (e.g., a string). This can be done in two ways:

Implicit type casting: this is when the data type is automatically converted to another data type
by the programming language, based on the context in which the value is used. For example,
in Python if you add an integer and a string, the integer will be implicitly converted to a
string and the two will be concatenated.

Here is an example of implicit type casting in Python:
////////////////CODE////////////////
#input method whixh take input from user automatically change the type of the objects in String till Explicitly user not defined the type of the object is.
age = input("Enter your age:-")
message = f"I am {age} years old."
print(message)  # Output: "I am {age} years old."
print(type(message))
////////////////////////////////////

Explicit type casting: this is when the programmer specifies the data type to which a value
should be converted. This is done using type casting functions. For example, in Python you ca
use the int() function to convert a value to an integer, or the str() function to convert a
value to a string.

Here is an example of explicit type casting in Python:
////////////////CODE////////////////
#This is the Example of Explicit type casting:-Wher we are forcing to change the type of the object.
age = 35
age_as_string = str(age)
print(age_as_string)  # Output: "35"
