Multi-processing is a programming technique where a program creates multiple
processes to perform different tasks simultaneously. Each process runs in parallel
with the other processes and has its own memory space and system resources, such as CPU and memory.

In Python, the multiprocessing module provides support for creating and managing multiple processes
in a program. Multi-processing is useful when a program needs to perform several CPU-intensive tasks
concurrently, such as running multiple machine learning models or simulating a large number of scenarios.

Using multi-processing can improve the overall performance of a program by allowing it to make better
use of available system resources, such as multiple CPU cores or machines. However, multi-processing
also comes with some challenges, such as managing communication and synchronization between processes
and dealing with potential issues like race conditions or deadlocks.

It's important to use multi-processing judiciously and design programs carefully to avoid these issues.
Multi-processing is particularly useful in situations where multi-threading is not sufficient or not possible,
such as when running CPU-intensive tasks on a single CPU machine or when dealing with I/O-bound tasks that
require waiting for external resources.
