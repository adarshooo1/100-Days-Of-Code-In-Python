Introduction of programming in pythonHere In 1st day of python printing
a line of code which tells about me and i am going to follow this 100
day of coding challange in Python.

What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language that is widely used for web development,
data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. It is a
high-level language, which means that it is more abstracted from the computer's
hardware and it is easier for humans to read and write than low-level languages
like C or Assembly.

One of the main features of Python is its simplicity and readability. Python code
is often said to be "Pythonic," which means that it follows the Python philosophy
of simplicity and readability. Python has a large and active community of users
and developers, which has contributed to the development of a wide range of
libraries and frameworks for different purposes.

Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means that you don't need to specify
the data type of a variable when you declare it. This makes it easier to write
code, but it can also make it more difficult to debug because the data type of
a variable can change at runtime.

Python is also an interpreted language, which means that it is not compiled to
machine code before it is executed. Instead, the Python interpreter reads and
executes the code directly. This makes it easier to write and debug Python code,
but it can also make the code slower to execute than compiled languages like C or C++.
