Here is a list of some common string methods in Python:

upper(): Converts a string to uppercase.
lower(): Converts a string to lowercase.
capitalize(): Converts the first character of a string to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.
title(): Converts the first character of each word in a string to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.
strip(): Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.
lstrip(): Removes leading whitespace from a string.
rstrip(): Removes trailing whitespace from a string.
replace(old, new): Replaces all occurrences of a string with another string.
split(separator): Splits a string into a list of strings using the specified separator.
join(iterable): Concatenates a list of strings into a single string, with the list elements separated by the string on which the method is called.

# Convert a string to uppercase
s = "hello world"
s = s.upper()
print(s)  # "HELLO WORLD"

# Convert a string to lowercase
s = "HELLO WORLD"
s = s.lower()
print(s)  # "hello world"

# Capitalize a string
s = "hello world"
s = s.capitalize()
print(s)  # "Hello world"

# Convert a string to title case
s = "hello world"
s = s.title()
print(s)  # "Hello World"

# Strip leading and trailing whitespace
s = "   hello world   "
s = s.strip()
print(s)  # "hello world"

# Replace a string
s = "hello world"
s = s.replace("world", "Python")
print(s)  # "hello Python"

# Split a string
s = "hello world"
words = s.split(" ")
print(words)  # ["hello", "world"]

# Join a list of strings
words = ["hello", "world"]
s = " ".join(words)
print(s)  # "hello world"

These are just a few examples of the string methods
available in Python. You can find more information
about them in the Python documentation.
