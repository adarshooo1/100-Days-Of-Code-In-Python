In Python, you can use conditionals to execute different blocks ofcode depending
on whether a certain condition is met. Here is an example of an if statement:
//////////////CODE//////////////////////////////
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
////////////////////////////////////////////////

In this example, the block of code indented under the if statement will be executed
if the condition x > 5 is True.

You can also use an if-else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if
the condition is True, and a different block of code to be executed if the condition
is False. For example:
////////////////////CODE///////////////////////////////////
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

In this case, the string "x is greater than 5" will be printed to the console because
the condition x > 5 is True.

You can also use an if-elif-else statement to specify multiple conditions and the
corresponding blocks of code to be executed. For example:
///////////////////////CODE////////////////////////////////////
x = 10

if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5 but not greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

In this case, the string "x is greater than 5 but not greater than 10" will be printed
to the console because the first condition is False and the second condition is True.

You can use any expression that returns a boolean value (True or False) as the
condition in an if statement. For example:
///////////////////////CODE/////////////////////////////////////////
x = 10

if x % 2 == 0:
    print("x is even")
else:
    print("x is odd")
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This code will print "x is even" to the console because the condition
x % 2 == 0 is True (the remainder of x divided by 2 is 0).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
