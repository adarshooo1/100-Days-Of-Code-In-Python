////////////////Loops////////////////
Case 1: for() loops.

In python we know that he use multiple print statement
for priting a block of Code.But We can'd do it for the whole day or for the 
large number in Input and output.So for loop do this work very simply
which iterate over the block of code.

In Python, you can use loops to execute a block
of code multiple times. There are two types of loops
in Python: for loops and while loopsA for loop is
used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list,
tuple, or string) or an iterable object 
(such as a dictionary, file, or set).
Here is an example of a for loop that iterates
over a list of numbers:

///////////////////CODE////////////////
 Way 1:-(To print 1 to 100)
 print(1)
 print(2)
 print(3)
 print(4)
    .
    .
    .
    .
 print(100)
 Like this way we have to print so many time which take so much time, patience and manforce.
 Life was this without for loop.
   

///////////////CODE////////////////
Way 2:-  (To print 1 to 100)
 Example 1: for i in range(1,101):
               print(i)
