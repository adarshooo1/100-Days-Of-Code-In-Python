what is pip?
pip is s standard package-management system used to install 
and manage software packages written in Python, Many packages 
can be found in the defalut source for packages and their
dependencies - Python package Index. Most distributions
of Python come and pip preinstalled;

How to install?
cmd- pip(pip not found) so install pip we have to give command 
cmd- yum install pythin-pip(It will install pip in the pc)
cmd-pip(Now it will tell the user that pip is installed)
cmd- pip list(will show that list installed in pip)

If Want to install some pip package?
cmd- pip install pandas
cmd- pip install paramiko

If want to un-install the pip packages?
cmd- pip uninstall paramiko
cmd- pip unistall pandas

For version check:-
cmd- pip --version


What is Module?
In Python, a module is a self-contained piece of code that contains
one or more functions, classes, or variables that you can use in your
programs. Modules are useful because they allow you to break up your
code into smaller, more manageable pieces, and they also allow you to
reuse code in multiple programs.

To use a module in your program, you first need to import it using
the import statement. For example:
///////////////////////////////////////
import math

x = math.cos(math.pi)
///////////////////////////////////////

In this example, the math module is being imported, and the cos function
from the module is being used to compute the cosine of pi.

There are many built-in modules in Python, and you can also create your own
custom modules. To create a custom module, you simply create a .py file with
your code and then import it into your program using the import statement.

How to install a Module?


To install a module in Python, you can use the pip command, which is a package
manager for Python. pip comes pre-installed with Python, so you should already
have it on your system.

To install a module using pip, open a terminal or command prompt and type the
following command:

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Copy code
pip install module_name
Replace module_name with the name of the module you want to install.
For example, to install the requests module, you would type:

Copy code
pip install requests
If you want to install a specific version of the module, you can specify 
the version number by using the == operator. For example:

Copy code
pip install requests==2.23.0
This will install version 2.23.0 of the requests module.

If you don't have permission to install packages system-wide, you can install
the package in your user directory by adding the --user flag to the pip command.
For example:

Copy code
pip install requests --user
This will install the requests module in your user directory, which you can then
import into your Python programs.
