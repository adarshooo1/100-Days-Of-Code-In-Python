Recursion is a method of solving problems in which a function calls itself as a subroutine.
The basic idea is to break a problem down into smaller and simpler subproblems, and then combine the
solutions to those subproblems to solve the original problem. This can be a powerful technique for
solving problems, but it can also be difficult to understand and debug if not used carefully.

Here's an example of a simple recursive function in Python that calculates the factorial of a given number:

///////////////////////////code/////////////////////
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

In this example, the function calls itself with a slightly simpler subproblem
(i.e. n-1) every time it is called. The function uses a base case,
which is a conditional statement (if n == 0: return 1) that stops the recursion when it is met.

It's important to note that recursion require a base case to stop, or it will loop infinitely.

It is also important to note that while recursion is a powerful problem-solving technique,
it can also be computationally expensive and lead to stack overflow errors if the recursion is not well-designed.
