Usually whenever we writting code then we always facing error and error code 
in every programming languages so We can edit that also and instead of throwing error
it will return some spectfic values or message whatever the user want.So, In this case
we will handle the Excaption in the Python code using excaption handling with the halp of 
Try() and except() blocks. 

Exception handling is the process of responding to unwanted and unexpected events when a 
computer program runs. Exception handling deals with these events to avoid the program or
system crashing, and without this process, Exception would disrupt the normal Exception
of a program


EXCEPTIONS IN PYTHON
Python has many built in Exceptions that are raised when your program encounter an error
(Sometimes in the program goes wrong)

When these exception error, the Python interpretator stops the current process and passes
it to the calling process until it is not handled, If not handeled,the program will crash.

Python TRY and EXCEPT
try: and Excapt: blocks are used in python to handle error and exception.
The code  in try block runs where there is no error.
If the try block catch error, then the except block is executed.


Syntax:-
try:
  /////////////////Write Code///////////////////

except ValueError :
    print("/////Write Message/////") 
except IndexError:
    print("/////Write Message/////")
