In python we have to raise custom error but, 
why any programmer want to raise any type
of error in programm?
Answer is Because of some limitations of the program
because sometimes user can give that input that a programm
cannot measure.

Example.1.
Input = int(input("Enter your input in Integer Between 1 to 9:- "))
//Now there may be a chance that user can type input:- 0 or may
be "String" then in that case programm will crash instead of crashing
and system faliure we will return an Exception and tell the user that
please a valid input to proceed in the program so:-
with the help of raise(Keyword) we will raised a custom error
like this:-

If(Inp <= 1 or Inp >= 9):
   rasise Exception("Value based error")
