# Short Hand If else Statement
# Example 1:
Num1 = 100;
Num2 = 101;
print("A") if Num1 > Num2 else print("=") if Num1 == Num2 else print("B")


# Example 2:
percentage = 41
Passing = 50
Result = "Pass" if Passing < percentage else "Fail"
print(Result)

#In smaller programs this increase readibility but when code is complex then It is not good to use. Because it also reduce readibility and less familiar with the new programmers
