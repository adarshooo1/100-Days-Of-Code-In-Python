If ... Else in one line
 There is also a shorthand synntax for the if-else statement that can be used when the condition being tested is simple and the code blocks to
 be executed are short Here's an Exanmple:

  Num1 = 100;
  Num2 = 101;
  print("A") if Num1 > Num2 else print("=") if Num1 == Num2 else print("B")
