How Import Works In Python

Import in Python is the process of loading code from a python module into the current script.
This allows you to use the functions and variables defined in the module in your current script,as
well as any additional modules that the imported module may depend upon.

To import a module in python, you use the import statement followed by the name of the module.
For example, to import the math module. 
contain a variety of mathematical function, you
would use the following statement

//////////////////////////////////////////
import math

#Once a module is imported,you can use any of the function and variable defined in the module
by using the dot notation. For example, to use the sqrt function from the math module, you would
write:

result = math.sqrt(9)
print(result) # Output = 3.0 
///////////////////////////////////////////


from Keyword
/////////////CODE///////////////////////////////
from math import sqrt,pi #(imported square root and pie from maths module not other unecesssary functions which is keyword.)

result2 = sqrt(81) * pi # Sqrt means square-root of 81 that is 9 and Pi means pie of mathematics 3.141592653589793
print(result2)
/////////////////////////////////////////////////

importing everything
It's also possible to import all functions and variable from a module using the *wildcard.
However, This is generally not recommended as it can lead to confusion and make it harder to
understand where specific functions and variable are coming from.

from math import *
result3 = sqrt(25)

print(result3)

print(pi)

/////////////////////////////////////////
# The "as" Keyword

import math as mth

result4 = mth.sqrt(81)
print(result4)
/////////////////////////////////////////

# The dir functions:-

finally, Python has a built-in function called dir that you can use to view the names of all the
function and variable defined in a module. This can be hepful for exploring and understanding
the contents of a new module.
